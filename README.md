✔️ A dictionary is a collection of key-value pairs.

✔️ They allow fast lookups, insertions, and deletions.

✔️ Perfect for storing relationships, like student names and scores, product IDs and names, or even user data!



🔑 𝑷𝒚𝒕𝒉𝒐𝒏 𝑺𝒆𝒕𝒔:

✔️ A set is an unordered collection of unique elements.

✔️ Sets are great for eliminating duplicates, checking membership, and performing mathematical operations like union, intersection, and difference.

✔️ Since they are unordered, they provide fast lookups and are ideal when uniqueness is required.
